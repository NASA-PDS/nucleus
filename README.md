### Prerequisites

The prerequisites to deploy and use Nucleus are available at:
https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nucleus/tree/main/terraform#prerequisites-to-deploy-nucleus-baseline-system  

---

## Test

The **Nucleus** workflows are tested using a basic **Registry Loader** workflow, which is deployed as part of the initial Nucleus deployment.  
This workflow includes several PDS tools such as **Validate**, **Harvest**, and **Archive**.

To test Nucleus:

1. Log in to the Nucleus web interface (URL and user credentials can be obtained from the Planetary Data System team).  
2. Execute the **basic registry loader** workflow.  
3. Verify that each workflow task reaches a **successful** state.  

A successful execution of all tasks in this workflow indicates that the Nucleus integration test has passed.
